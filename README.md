# Basic-Calculator-Example
This program was created in order to display how to utilize template functions in C++ 

Basic-Calculator-Example v2.0
This program was updated to show how 'Exception handling' might be beneficial to your programs in C++ and can be very beneficial to everyone. 
To best show how exception handling might be useful I decided to go back into my basicCalculatorExample and I chose the divide() to add a try, catch, and throw if the user might throw a bad variable, like 0 (since you can't divide by 0).
